Concept: Create a Whack-a-Mole game based on traditional rules and objectives.

A full description of what your project is all about
In my Whack-a-Mole game you have 30 seconds to try and 'whack' as many moles and possible. The moles will come out of their hills at random times and in random orders. Once the timer is done, your scoreboard will reflect how many moles you whacked.

Technologies Used:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript

Overview

I attended office hours with Mateen and saw how to make a wireframe in figma. I used this wireframe as a basis for my direction with the game. After this, I worked with the help a programming friend of mine in order to achieve a result similar to the wireframe. There were some differences.

Wireframe



Color Pallet:

    #rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.815
    #rgba 0, 0, 0, 0.84
    #rgba 0,0,0,0.2
    #rgb 39, 61, 107
    # white;
   
User stories

If the user selects the 'Start' button, the moles will begin to come from their hills and the 30 second timer will begin to count down. The player will have 30 seconds to whack as many moles as possible by clickin on them.

Challenges:

Working in JS has been difficult for me and a learning curve. Via some help from a developer friend, my classmates, and my teachers I was able to overcome the difficulties.
